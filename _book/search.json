    "text": "2.1 Undergraduates\nAll data come from UCUES\n\n2.1.1 Food Security\nStudent respondents are assigned a food security level: very low food security, low food security, or food secure, based on their responses to six questions.\nFor more information on this measure, please visit UCOP Measuring Food Insecurity\n\n2.1.1.1 Food Security over Time\nThese visuals display the percentage respondents who are “food secure. For example, in 2022 58% of UCSD undergraduate respondents were classified as food secure. This means the remaining 42% of respondents were food insecure- either low food security or very low food security.\nThe percent of undergraduates who are food secure has remained relatively stable over time -between roughly 50-60%. UCSD’s food security rates are slightly higher or equal to the overal UC system rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Food Security Differences by Group\nFocusing on UCSD students in 2022, we find that there are significant differences by student group. Students who are not First Generation (64%), not Pell Grant Recipients (64%), or are White (63%) or Asian (61%) as defined by UCOP have higher rates of food security than the student body average of 58%. Food security among international students is the same as the student body average.\nConversely, the food security rates of American Indian students (50%), First Generation students (49%) Pell Grant recipients (48%), Hispanic or Latinx students (48%) or African American students(44%), are less than the student body average. For all these groups, at least half of students are food insecure. The span of the difference is 20 percentage points- between students who don’t recieve Pell Grants (64%) and African American students (44%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Housing Costs\nThe prioritization poll selected two housing questions from the most recent UCUES 2022 wave- these questions had not been asked previously. There are other housing related questions future versions of this document can add to provide historical context.\nThe question block prompts: “For the following statements, please indicate whether the statement was never true, sometimes true, or often true for you during the current academic year:”\n“I was unable to pay all the cost of my housing on time.”\n“I was worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing”\nRespondents could select “Never True”, “Sometime True” and “Often True.” For consistency in selecting positive responses - I focus on “Never True” responses- meaning that respondents never were unable to pay (always able to pay) and never worried about their housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 80% of students were always able to pay for housing costs on time at UCSD, meaning 20% of students were sometimes or often unable to pay on time. THis propotion is slightly higher than the UC average of 77% alway able to pay (not pictured). This division differs by students groups. Proportions differ by 17 percentage points, from 72% for African American students to 89% for American Indian students.\nHowever, most students worry about paying for housing. Overall 46% never worry -similar to the UC average of 45%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Worried about Debt/Finances\nUCUES has asked “How often during the past academic year have you: Worried about my debt and financial circumstances? since 2014.\nThe question has six possible responses -from negative - Very Often, Often,Somewhat Often, and occasionally, to two coded as positive: rarely and never.\n\n\n2.1.4 Change over Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Difference between Students\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'comp', 'group_label'.
