    "text": "2.1 Undergraduates\n\n2.1.1 Graduation Rates\n\n2.1.1.1 First-Time-First-Years\nFirst, we examine the percentage of First-Time-First-Year (FTFY) students who graduate within six years or less of starting at UCSD. The below visual shows six year graduation rates for the entering cohort of 2016. Overall, 85% of FTFY students entering in 2016 graduated in six years or less. The proportion of students who recieve Pell Grants, and First Generation students, have slightly lower graduation rates of 83% and 84% respectively.\nThe largest equity gaps emerge when considering Race and Ethnicity. Hispanic / Latinx, African American, and American Indian students each have lower than average graduation rates, of 81%, 78%, and 74% respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining the proportion of students who graduate within four years or less shows a similar pattern of equity gaps, however the divergence between student groups grows larger. For the most recent entry cohort available, 2018, about 73% of students graduate in four years or less. However, that proportion drops to 55%, just over half, for African American students in that entering cohort, and 12% for Hispanic/Latinx.\nNeed to document change over time- there’s a small number of American Indian students and proportions are more variable year over year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Transfer Students\nOverall, the size of equity gaps between transfer students is smaller, Transfer student graduation rates within four years or fewer is about 87% for all Transfer students.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering equity gaps in “on-time” graduation -two years or less- the overall average falls to about 57%. However, the difference between student groups relative to this average is relatively small, with the exception of African American transfer students, 46% of whom entering in 2020 graduated within two years or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 One Year Retention\nRetention rates over the first year are on average very high, with 93% of FTFY students remaining enrolled after the first year, and 92-93% of Transfer students. African American students have lower retention rates, at 83% for FTFY students.\n** Change over Time is Important and needs to be considered- especially for American Indian students **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 GPA\nThe below visual provides just one view of GPA, the GPA of students at graduation, specifically the percent of students graduating with less than a 3.0 GPA (2.0-2.99)\nDepartment/ Major is one unmeasured component in these comparisons, where internal analyses like Academic Program Review offer more sophisticated analyses. However, the following visual shows what is possible with publicly available data.\nThis visual also does not include students who drop or stop out prior to graduating.\nAbout 15% of all graduating undergraduates in 2022 had a GPA below 3.0 at graduation. However, a higher proportion of Transfer students, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx students graduate with a GPA below 3.0, 19%, 26%, and 25% respectively."

    "text": "3.1 Undergraduates\nThis section covers a few questions prioritized by the Affordable Learning and Financial Support collective impact working group.\nPlease refer to Section 1.1.1 for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on Instiutional Research’s Dashboard\n\n3.1.1 Food Security\nStudent respondents are assigned a food security level: very low food security, low food security, or food secure, based on their responses to six questions.\nFor more information on this measure, please visit UCOP Measuring Food Insecurity\n\n3.1.1.1 Food Security over Time\nThese visuals display the percentage of respondents who are “food insecure” or “very food insecure”. For example, in 2022, 42% of UCSD undergraduate respondents were classified as food insecure or very food insecure. This means the remaining 58% of respondents were food secure.\nThe percent of undergraduates who are food insecure has remained relatively stable over time. UCSD’s food insecurity rates are slightly lower or equal to the overall UC system rate for this time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Food Security Differences by Group\nFocusing on UCSD students in 2022, we find that there are significant differences by student group. In comparison to the all undergraduate proportion of 42% food insecure, the proportion is higher for Pell Grant Recipients (51%), First Generation students (52%), African American students (55%), Hispanic/Latinx students (52%) and American Indian students (50%).\nOverall, there is ~18 percentage point difference between the group with the lowest food insecurity - domestic, White students (37%) and that with the highest, African American students (55%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Housing Costs\nThe prioritization poll selected two housing questions from the most recent UCUES 2022 wave- these questions had not been asked previously. There are other housing related questions future versions of this document can add to provide historical context.\nThe question block prompts: “For the following statements, please indicate whether the statement was never true, sometimes true, or often true for you during the current academic year:”\n“I was unable to pay all the cost of my housing on time.”\n“I was worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing”\nRespondents could select “Never True”, “Sometime True” or “Often True.” For consistency in selecting negative responses - we focus on “Sometimes True” and “Often True” responses- meaning that respondents were unable to pay and worried about their housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20% of students were sometimes or often unable to pay on time. This proportion is slightly lower than the UC average of 23% of students unable to pay (not pictured).\nWithin UCSD, the proportion of students unable to pay on time ranges from 28% for African American students to 11% for American Indian students, a 17 percentage point difference.\nThe proportion of students who worry about paying housing costs is higher. Overall 46% worry -similar to the UC average of 45%. However, there is a wide range by student groups at UCSD, from 68% of Pell Grant students worrying, to only 44% of those who don’t receive Pell, a difference of over 20 percentage points. The proportions for Hispanic/Latinx and African American students who worry is also high, around 62%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Worried about Debt/Finances\nUCUES has asked “How often during the past academic year have you: Worried about debt and financial circumstances?” since 2014.\nThe question has six possible responses -three coded negative: Very Often, Often,Somewhat Often, and three as more positive: Occasionally, Rarely, Never. We focus here on the negative responses.\nOverall, UCSD’s students are similar to or slightly less worried than the UC average, with the percent of students worried falling for both in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s notable that while 2022 saw a decrease in students worried, stark differences remain by student group,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Manageable Costs\nForty-two percent of students somewhat disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree that the total cost of attending UCSD is manageable, given the the grants and scholarships they receive. Over the past four waves of UCUES, UCSD has had slightly higher proportions of students disagree that it is manageable than the UC average.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the consistent gaps by student group observed for other affordability questions partially reverse in this question.\nThose who do not receive Pell Grants, and not First Generation students have a higher proportion of negative responses. 49% of students not receiving Pell Grants disagree that the cost of UCSD is manageable, compared to 30% of Pell Grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Additional UCUES Questions related to Affordability.\nThese questions are also available on the 2022 UCUES for further exploration.\n\nOverall, I feel the education is affordable at my campus\nHow satisfied are you with the following aspect of your campus experiences/education? Value of your education for the price you are paying.\nHow concerned have you been about paying for your undergraduate education up to now?\n…Next Year?\nHow often during the past academic year have you: cut down on personal / recreational spending to help pay for college expenses?"

    "title": "3  Affordable Learning and Financial Support",
    "section": "3.3 Affordable and Open Course Materials",
    "text": "3.3 Affordable and Open Course Materials\nThe following paragraphs are quoted verbatim from the Affordable / Open course Materials Report - May 2022.\nIn November 2021, a team from the Library and the Teaching + Learning Commons (April Cha, Dani Cook, Leah Klement, Lisa Martin, and Allegra Swift) fielded a population-level survey about student experiences with obtaining and using course materials.\nWith help from William Armstrong in Institutional Research, we sent 32,827 survey invitations to UC San Diego undergraduate students. 2,153 students consented and participated in the survey, for a response rate of 6.6%. Demographic characteristics of both the full population and responding population fell within 2 percentage points of each other for college, major department, race, first-generation status, and Pell eligibility. Female students were overrepresented in the responding population, and transfer students were slightly underrepresented in respondents.\nQuestions on the survey related to student spending on course materials in fall 2021; how students pay for course materials; student strategies when they don’t own course materials; student interest in an inclusive access program; academic, social, and basic needs impacts of course materials cost and access; and format preference.\n\n3.3.1 Student Spending\nThe largest number of students reported spending under $100 (38%) on course materials in fall 2021. However, a similar number of students reported spending between $100 and $199 dollars (33.4%), and the remaining 29% reported spending over $200 on course materials. A small number of students (.7%) reported spending more than $600. One representative statement was, “I think it’s expected to spend money on courses and textbooks, it just hits lower-income students harder for obvious reasons.”\nSome free-text responses mention departments that already keep material costs low, including CSE and political science. These may be areas to reach out to for more information.\nWe also investigated if there was a relationship between how much students spent on course materials and their usage. There does appear to be a correlation between cost and usage (p<.001). In general, students reported using most (above 80%) of their required course materials across categories (31.2% of respondents). However, there were numerous students who reported that they used below 50% of their assigned course materials in a quarter, and the qualitative data represented that some students felt frustrated that they were assigned materials that they did not use in the course. Student comments related to this topics included: “I do not mind buying course materials if it is used for at least 50% of the course. Otherwise it feels like a waste” and “It would be great if professors specified beforehand if we will actually be using the textbook. Sometimes it’s listed as required but never used.” This was the second-most commented-on topic in the qualitative data.\nOf students who spent below $100, 10% of them reported never using any of their course materials. However, the preponderance of students in this category (31.4%) reported using 80% or more of their assigned course materials.\nFor the top spenders (students who spend $600 or more), most (56.25%) reported using most of their materials, and all reported using at least some.\nLatinx students were slightly more likely to spend in the higher price bands than other groups.\nBy a significant margin, most students reported that they paid for their course materials through money provided by family, friends, or caregivers (43.3%), followed by money they had earned themselves (29.9%) and grants (12.7%). The chart below demonstrates differences across racial categories:\n White and Asian/Asian American students are much more likely to report having family, friend, or caregiver support for purchasing course materials.\nSimilar disparate impacts were demonstrated due to first-generation status:\n\n\n\nStudent Source of Payment for Course Materials\n\n\n80% of students reported having to purchase access codes (one-time-use codes to access homework sets, quizzes, or other ancillary materials) during their time at UC San Diego. There does not appear to be a relationship between student major and access code purchasing, indicating that this is a broadly utilized type of course material across disciplines. It is also unclear from our data if access codes are more often used in major courses or in general education.\nBy far, access codes was the area that students shared the most about in the qualitative data. “Frustration” was the most commonly used adjective. One student shared, “Purchasing access codes to complete homework for a grade is ridiculous. We already pay tuition, we shouldn’t have to pay hundreds for our grades too.”\n\n\n3.3.2 Strategies for Obtaining Course Materials\n96% of students who answered the survey indicated that they had attempted to reduce course material costs during their UC San Diego career. 64% of students shared that they had downloaded a “free” textbook from the Internet (we did not ask about the legal status of the copy) and almost half of students (49%) relying on materials that course instructors provided through Canvas or other means.\nThe most common reason given for seeking alternative methods to buying a course material was because of the cost of the book, followed by because only a small portion of the material was used in class. Only a small number of students (1.8%) indicated familiarity with library course reserves.\n\n\n3.3.3 Inclusive Access Program Interest\n66% of students said they would be interested in a standardized fee for materials from the Bookstore (though many indicated they wanted to know more about the cost). Without having additional details, 95% of respondents believed that a reasonable cost for such a program would be under $150 per quarter.\n\n\n3.3.4 Basic Needs Impacts\n27% of students who responded to the survey indicated that they had to make a choice between purchasing course materials and basic needs.\n41.6% of Pell-eligible students who answered the question about basic needs reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.\nIn comparison, 20.3% of non-Pell-eligible students who answered this question reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.\nThe most commonly reported basic need impacted was access to food, followed by mental health/well-being and utilities.\n ### Academic and Social Impacts\nThe survey also asked questions about how access to course materials impacted their academic and social lives at UC San Diego.\n14.2% of students overall reported that lack of access to course materials strongly impacted their understanding of key course concepts. This impact was felt variably across demographic categories. Notably, 20.9% of Latinx students reported a strong impact on their understanding of course concepts, while only 9.6% of white students reported a strong impact.\nOverall, 10.9% of students reported that a lack of access to course materials has affected their feeling of belonging in their course or major. Again, this impact was felt variably across demographic categories. 28.1% of black students reported a strong impact, while only 7.7% of white students reported the same. This was also true across low-income students (as identified by Pell-grant eligibility), where 41.6% of Pell-eligible students reported an impact on feelings of belonging, in contrast to 29% of non-Pell-eligible students.\n\n\n3.3.5 Format Preferences\nStudents were queried for their format preferences for course materials. There is a strong belief that students prefer electronic sources; however, our survey results indicate that may not be an accurate belief. While students preferred PDFs or other digital documents, this was closely followed by professional printed textbooks. The below chart demonstrates the rank-ordered student preferences.\n ## Appendix: Response Rates by Question\n\n\n3.3.6 Undergraduates: UCUES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      UCSD Student Response Counts\n    \n    \n      UCUES 2022\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        UCUES Questions\n      \n    \n    \n      Food Security\n      I was unable to pay all of the cost of my housing on time.\n      I worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing.\n      Worried about my debt and financial circumstances\n      ...Total cost of attending is manageable\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      All\n    \n    All\n8532\n8489\n8496\n8517\n8485\n    \n      Applicant Level\n    \n    First-Time First Year\n6658\n6619\n6626\n6642\n6616\n    Transfer\n1874\n1870\n1870\n1875\n1869\n    \n      First Gen\n    \n    First Generation\n3153\n3140\n3139\n3149\n3141\n    Not First Generation\n5154\n5122\n5130\n5139\n5116\n    \n      Pell\n    \n    Not Pell Grant Recipient\n5301\n5274\n5277\n5281\n5255\n    Pell Grant Recipient\n3231\n3215\n3219\n3236\n3230\n    \n      Race\n    \n    African American\n250\n248\n249\n250\n250\n    American Indian\n36\n36\n36\n36\n36\n    Asian\n3529\n3531\n3532\n3542\n3530\n    Hispanic/Latinx\n1852\n1832\n1833\n1842\n1840\n    International\n945\n936\n938\n930\n921\n    White\n1690\n1682\n1683\n1688\n1682\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.7 Graduate Students (UCGSES)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      UCSD Student Response Counts\n    \n    \n      UCGSES 2021\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        UCGSES Questions\n      \n      I can get by financially ...\n    \n    \n      Food security\n      Financial hardship has impeded my success in my program.\n      I've been concerned about money lately.\n      I'm confident in my financial situation.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      All\n    \n    All\n802\n894\n896\n898\n896\n    \n      First Gen\n    \n    First Generation\nNA\n374\n375\n375\n375\n    Not First Generation\nNA\n438\n438\n439\n438\n    \n      Level\n    \n    Academic Doctor\n545\n556\n557\n558\n557\n    Academic Masters\n196\n199\n200\n201\n200\n    Professional Masters\nNA\n108\n108\n108\n108\n    Graduate Professional\n130\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n    \n      LGBT\n    \n    LGBT\n147\n146\n146\n146\n146\n    Not LGBT\n722\n693\n695\n695\n694\n    \n      Race\n    \n    African American\n18\n18\n18\n18\n18\n    Asian\n152\n154\n154\n155\n155\n    Hispanic/ Latinx\n81\n82\n82\n82\n82\n    International\n317\n333\n335\n336\n334\n    White\n268\n273\n273\n273\n273\n    American Indian\n3\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```"
