    "text": "1.1 Data Sources\n\n1.1.1 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES)\nThe University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) is a biennial survey conducted at the UC’s nine undergraduate campuses. Student responses are collected in the spring quarter of the survey year.\nFor more about UCUES across the UC, and data tables from 2006 onwards, please see this page on UC Infocenter.\nA summary of UCUES at UCSD can be found on UCSD IR website here. A longitudinal comparison of some questions at UCSD can be found here for those with an Active Directory login.\n\n1.1.1.1 Student Group Definitions -UCUES\nIn this book, all student group are reported separately, considered one at a time. It does not consider identities jointly, e.g. whether that same student is a transfer student and also Asian American. Joint analysis is not possible using publicly available data. If a student’s identity is unknown or “other”, it is currently removed from the analysis for that specific comparison.\nThe following text is quoted directly from the UC Infocenter UCUES website under the “Notes” Section.\n\nFirst-Generation: Indicates that neither parent of a student has a four-year college degree\nRace/Ethnicity: Identifies a student’s race/ethnicity in one of seven categories (i.e., African American, American Indian, Hispanic/Latino(a), Asian, White, International, or Unknown) based on UC’s spring term enrollment data. Winter or fall term data is used if spring data is not available. In this book, we have removed “unknown” responses for clarity of presentation. For more on how UC aggregates student’s race and ethnicity identities please see this document\nPell Grant: An indicator showing whether a student received a Pell Grant during the academic year in which the student took the survey.\nApplicant Type: an indicator showing whether a student is a first-time first-year / freshman applicant -meaning they have not enrolled in a regular session at a college or university prior to matriculating, or Transfer Students, with prior regular session experience at a college or university.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2 Demographics of UCSD Undergraduates\nAs of Fall 2022, the following visual describes the percentage of UCSD students in each group, including groups whose UCUES responses are not publicly available (sexual orientation) and not included in this analysis at this time (CA residency). This visual is available for more interactive exploration at the UC Infocenter. Up to date UCSD specific student counts can be found at UCSD IR 3rd Week Enrollment Dashboard\n\n\n\nUCSD Undergraduate Population 2022\n\n\nAbout 33% of enrolled undergraduates are Transfer students, according to UCSD Admissions and the UCSD Triton Transfer provides a helpful infographic on Transfer students at UCSD\n\n\n1.1.1.3 Completion Rates on UCUES Survey\nAbout 26% of all UCSD undergraduate students completed the 2022 UCUES survey - defined as opening the survey, responding to at least one question, and submitting responses. Within each student group, the completion rate is within 2-3 percentage points of this overall average, with the exception of International students who have a lower completion rate -just 18% of UCSD international students completed the survey.\nFor the number of respondents to each UCUES question examined, please see the appendix of each chater.\n\nFor an interactive view of UCUES survey completion and response rates, please see UC Infocenter\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 University of California Graduate Student Experience Survey (UCGSES)\nThis UC-wide has been conducted once, in 2021. The data table for all UC campuses is available at the UC Infocenter\n\n1.1.2.1 Student Group Definition (UCGSES)\n\nFirst-Generation: Indicates that neither parent of a student has a four-year college degree\nRace/Ethnicity: Identifies a student’s race/ethnicity in one of seven categories (i.e., African American, American Indian, Hispanic/Latino(a), Asian, White, International, or Unknown) based on UC’s spring term enrollment data. Winter or fall term data is used if spring data is not available. In this book, we have removed “unknown” responses for clarity of presentation. Given the low number of respondents for UCGSES at UCSD, not all of these categories are available for every question in this group. For more on how UC aggregates student’s race and ethnicity identities please see this document\nSexual Orientation: UC began collecting sexual orientation data on the undergraduate application in Fall 2016, and over a phased in timeline on the graduate application since 2016. As a result, this data may not be comprehensive as some enrolled students (particularly those who entered prior to 2016) may not have faced this question on the application. Unknown sexual orientation includes a mix of students who chose not to indicate a category and those who never had the opportunity to provide the information. Data should be interpreted with caution in the early years of the collection as it is not comprehensive.\nStudent Level: The UCGSES reports student level in the following categories: Academic Masters, who are students pursuing MS, MA, or MFA degrees, Professional Masters: MBA, MF, MCEP, and MAS programs, Doctoral PhDs, and Professional Practice: MD, Pharm.D.\n\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Demographics of UCSD Graduate Students\nThe following visual provides a view of UCSD graduate student demographics.\n\n\n\nUCSD Graduate Population 2022\n\n\nAcademic Masters students comprise 26% of UCSD graduate students,Professional Masters as 13%, Academic Doctors as 50% and Professional Practice as 11%. Future versions will include a visual of this breakdown.\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Completion Rates of UCGSES 2022\nUC San Diego had a lower than average response rate for graduate students in comparison with the other UC campuses.\n\n\n\nUCGSES 2021\n\n\nThe overall completion rate of UCGSES 2021 at UCSD was 12%. A few groups have notable lower completion rates: Professional practice: 4%, African American: 9%, and American Indian: 7%.\nFor a more interactive view of survey completion and response rates please see: UC Infocenter Survey Completion -be sure to use filters to select UCGSES 2021 at UCSD or the Student Profile tab on UCGSES Dashboard.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Additional Surveys\nFuture versions of this report may include information from other student surveys\nUndergraduates\n\nThe CIRP Freshman Survey /New Transfer Survey\nYour College First Year Survey\nCollege Senior Survey\nPost Baccalaureate\nCost of Attendance Survey\n\nGraduate Students UCSD data is available here\n\nGraduate Student Experience in the Resarch University (gradSERU)\nGraduate Student Well-Being Survey\nGraduate and Professional Student Experience and Satisfaction (GPSES)\nGraduate Student Exit Survey\nCost of Attendance Survey"

    "text": "2.1 Undergraduates\nThis section covers a few questions prioritized by the Affordable Learning and Financial Support collective impact working group. Please refer to Section 1.1.1 for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on Institutional Research’s Dashboard\n\n2.1.1 Food Security\nThe UC food security measure is defined by a student’s responses to a set of six questions. Each student is assigned a status of “very low food security”, “low food security”, or “food secure” For more information on this measure, please visit UCOP Measuring Food Insecurity\nThese visuals display the combined percentage of respondents who are “food insecure” or “very food insecure”. For example, in 2022, 42% of UCSD undergraduate respondents were classified as food insecure or very food insecure, and the remaining 58% of respondents were classified as food secure. The percent of undergraduates who are food insecure has remained relatively stable over time. UCSD’s food insecurity rates are slightly lower or equal to the overall UC system rate for this time period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on UCSD students in 2022, we find that there are substantial differences by student group. In comparison to the all undergraduate proportion of 42% food insecure, the proportion is higher for Pell Grant recipients (51%), first-generation students (52%), African American students (55%), Hispanic/Latinx students (52%) and American Indian students (50%) and Transfer students (50%). Overall, there is ~18 percentage point difference between the group with the lowest food insecurity - domestic, White students (37%) and that with the highest, domestic, African American students (55%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Housing Costs\nThe prioritization poll selected two housing questions from the most recent UCUES 2022 wave- these questions had not been asked on earlier waves. There are other housing related questions that future versions of this document can add to provide historical context.\nThe question block prompts: “For the following statements, please indicate whether the statement was never true, sometimes true, or often true for you during the current academic year:”\n“I was unable to pay all the cost of my housing on time.”\n“I was worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing”\nRespondents could select “Never True”, “Sometimes True” or “Often True.” For consistency in selecting negative responses - we focus on “Sometimes True” and “Often True” responses- meaning that respondents were unable to pay and worried about their housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20% of UCSD students were sometimes or often unable to pay on time. This proportion is slightly lower than the UC average of 23% of students unable to pay (not pictured).\nWithin UCSD, the proportion of students unable to pay on time ranges from 28% for African American students to 11% for American Indian students, a 17 percentage point difference.\nThe proportion of students who worry about paying housing costs is higher than that of student who are unable to pay. Overall 46% of UCSD students worry -inline with the UC proportion of 45% (not pictured). However, there is a wide range by student groups at UCSD, from 68% of Pell Grant students worrying, to only 44% of those who don’t receive Pell, a difference of over 20 percentage points. The proportions for Hispanic/Latinx and African American students who worry is also high, around 62%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Worried about Debt/Finances\nUCUES has asked “How often during the past academic year have you: Worried about debt and financial circumstances?” since 2014.\nThe question has six possible responses -three coded negative: Very Often, Often, Somewhat Often, and three as more positive: Occasionally, Rarely, Never. We focus here on the negative responses.\nOverall, UCSD’s students are similar to or slightly less worried than the UC average, with the percent of students worried falling for both in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s notable that while 2022 saw a decrease in students worried, stark differences remain by student group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Manageable Costs\nForty-two percent of students somewhat disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree that the total cost of attending UCSD is manageable, given the the grants and scholarships they receive. Over the past four waves of UCUES, UCSD has had slightly higher proportions of students disagree that the cost is manageable than the UC average.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the consistent gaps by student group observed for other affordability questions partially reverse in this question. Those who do not receive Pell Grants, and not first-generation students have a higher proportion of negative responses. 49% of students not receiving Pell Grants disagree that the cost of UCSD is manageable, compared to 30% of Pell Grant recipients. The direction also reverses for Transfer students who have lower proporitons of negative responses than first-time-first-year students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Additional UCUES Questions related to Affordability.\nThese questions are also available on the 2022 UCUES for further exploration.\n\nOverall, I feel the education is affordable at my campus\nHow satisfied are you with the following aspect of your campus experiences/education? Value of your education for the price you are paying.\nHow concerned have you been about paying for your undergraduate education up to now?\n…Next Year?\nHow often during the past academic year have you: cut down on personal / recreational spending to help pay for college expenses?"

    "text": "2.2 Graduate Students\nThere have been fewer consistent questions asked to graduate students over time, and slightly different student groups are available in publicly available data. See data descriptions for more detail. The following draw from the UC Graduate Student Experience Survey in 2021, with the exception of Food Security, which includes data from the 2016 Graduate Student Wellbeing Survey. Please refer to Section 1.1.2 for more on UCGSES.\n\n2.2.1 Food Security\nFor the two waves available for Graduate Students, UCSD has similar rates of food insecurity in comparison with the UC average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Financial hardship has impeded my success in my program.\nGraduate students were asked to indicate their agreement with this statement “Financial Hardship has impeded my success in my program.” Students who selected “Strongly Agree”, “Agree”, and “Somewhat Agree” were coded as “negative” responses.\nWhile about 36% of students agreed that financial hardship had impeded their success, similar to the all-UC rate of 35% (not pictured), that number rises to 52% for Hispanic/Latinx students. First-generation, LGBT, African American, Doctoral students, and International students also have higher levels of agreement than average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 I’ve been concerned about money lately.\nThis question continues the format of the previous, with similar patterns of differences between groups. The UCSD proportion of students who agree they are concerned about money lately is about 66%, similar the all-UC proportion of 67%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 I’m confident in my financial situation.\nFor this question, “Strongly Disagree,” “Disagree”, and “Somewhat Disagree” were considered negative responses. There is a divergence between UCSD and the all UC rate, with a lower proportion of UCSD students disagreeing - 31% vs 34% of all UC respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 I can get by financially without having to cut back on too many of the things that are important to me.\nFor this question, “Strongly Disagree,” “Disagree”, and “Somewhat Disagree” were considered negative responses. Again, the proportion for all UCSD students (32%) is relatively similiar to the all UC proportion (34%)"

    "section": "2.3 Course Material Student Survey",
    "text": "2.3 Course Material Student Survey\nThe following paragraphs are quoted verbatim from the Affordable / Open course Materials Report - May 2022.\nIn November 2021, a team from the Library and the Teaching + Learning Commons (April Cha, Dani Cook, Leah Klement, Lisa Martin, and Allegra Swift) fielded a population-level survey about student experiences with obtaining and using course materials.\nWith help from William Armstrong in Institutional Research, we sent 32,827 survey invitations to UC San Diego undergraduate students. 2,153 students consented and participated in the survey, for a response rate of 6.6%. Demographic characteristics of both the full population and responding population fell within 2 percentage points of each other for college, major department, race, first-generation status, and Pell eligibility. Female students were overrepresented in the responding population, and transfer students were slightly underrepresented in respondents.\nQuestions on the survey related to student spending on course materials in fall 2021; how students pay for course materials; student strategies when they don’t own course materials; student interest in an inclusive access program; academic, social, and basic needs impacts of course materials cost and access; and format preference.\n\n2.3.1 Student Spending\nThe largest number of students reported spending under $100 (38%) on course materials in fall 2021. However, a similar number of students reported spending between $100 and $199 dollars (33.4%), and the remaining 29% reported spending over $200 on course materials. A small number of students (.7%) reported spending more than $600. One representative statement was, “I think it’s expected to spend money on courses and textbooks, it just hits lower-income students harder for obvious reasons.”\nSome free-text responses mention departments that already keep material costs low, including CSE and political science. These may be areas to reach out to for more information.\nWe also investigated if there was a relationship between how much students spent on course materials and their usage. There does appear to be a correlation between cost and usage (p<.001). In general, students reported using most (above 80%) of their required course materials across categories (31.2% of respondents). However, there were numerous students who reported that they used below 50% of their assigned course materials in a quarter, and the qualitative data represented that some students felt frustrated that they were assigned materials that they did not use in the course. Student comments related to this topics included: “I do not mind buying course materials if it is used for at least 50% of the course. Otherwise it feels like a waste” and “It would be great if professors specified beforehand if we will actually be using the textbook. Sometimes it’s listed as required but never used.” This was the second-most commented-on topic in the qualitative data.\nOf students who spent below $100, 10% of them reported never using any of their course materials. However, the preponderance of students in this category (31.4%) reported using 80% or more of their assigned course materials.\nFor the top spenders (students who spend $600 or more), most (56.25%) reported using most of their materials, and all reported using at least some.\nLatinx students were slightly more likely to spend in the higher price bands than other groups.\nBy a significant margin, most students reported that they paid for their course materials through money provided by family, friends, or caregivers (43.3%), followed by money they had earned themselves (29.9%) and grants (12.7%). The chart below demonstrates differences across racial categories:\n\n\n\nStudent Source of Payment for Course Materials: Race/Ethnicity\n\n\nWhite and Asian/Asian American students are much more likely to report having family, friend, or caregiver support for purchasing course materials.\nSimilar disparate impacts were demonstrated due to first-generation status:\n\n\n\nStudent Source of Payment for Course Materials: first-generation Status\n\n\n80% of students reported having to purchase access codes (one-time-use codes to access homework sets, quizzes, or other ancillary materials) during their time at UC San Diego. There does not appear to be a relationship between student major and access code purchasing, indicating that this is a broadly utilized type of course material across disciplines. It is also unclear from our data if access codes are more often used in major courses or in general education.\nBy far, access codes was the area that students shared the most about in the qualitative data. “Frustration” was the most commonly used adjective. One student shared, “Purchasing access codes to complete homework for a grade is ridiculous. We already pay tuition, we shouldn’t have to pay hundreds for our grades too.”\n\n\n2.3.2 Strategies for Obtaining Course Materials\n96% of students who answered the survey indicated that they had attempted to reduce course material costs during their UC San Diego career. 64% of students shared that they had downloaded a “free” textbook from the Internet (we did not ask about the legal status of the copy) and almost half of students (49%) relying on materials that course instructors provided through Canvas or other means.\nThe most common reason given for seeking alternative methods to buying a course material was because of the cost of the book, followed by because only a small portion of the material was used in class. Only a small number of students (1.8%) indicated familiarity with library course reserves.\n\n\n2.3.3 Inclusive Access Program Interest\n66% of students said they would be interested in a standardized fee for materials from the Bookstore (though many indicated they wanted to know more about the cost). Without having additional details, 95% of respondents believed that a reasonable cost for such a program would be under $150 per quarter.\n\n\n2.3.4 Basic Needs Impacts\n27% of students who responded to the survey indicated that they had to make a choice between purchasing course materials and basic needs.\n41.6% of Pell-eligible students who answered the question about basic needs reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.\nIn comparison, 20.3% of non-Pell-eligible students who answered this question reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.\nThe most commonly reported basic need impacted was access to food, followed by mental health/well-being and utilities.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Academic and Social Impacts\nThe survey also asked questions about how access to course materials impacted their academic and social lives at UC San Diego.\n14.2% of students overall reported that lack of access to course materials strongly impacted their understanding of key course concepts. This impact was felt variably across demographic categories. Notably, 20.9% of Latinx students reported a strong impact on their understanding of course concepts, while only 9.6% of white students reported a strong impact.\nOverall, 10.9% of students reported that a lack of access to course materials has affected their feeling of belonging in their course or major. Again, this impact was felt variably across demographic categories. 28.1% of black students reported a strong impact, while only 7.7% of white students reported the same. This was also true across low-income students (as identified by Pell-grant eligibility), where 41.6% of Pell-eligible students reported an impact on feelings of belonging, in contrast to 29% of non-Pell-eligible students.\n\n\n2.3.6 Format Preferences\nStudents were queried for their format preferences for course materials. There is a strong belief that students prefer electronic sources; however, our survey results indicate that may not be an accurate belief. While students preferred PDFs or other digital documents, this was closely followed by professional printed textbooks. The below chart demonstrates the rank-ordered student preferences.\n This concludes the excerpt on the report on the Course Material Survey in this document.
