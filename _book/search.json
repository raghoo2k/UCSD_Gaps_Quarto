    "text": "2.1 Undergraduates\nThis section covers a few questions prioritized by the Affordable Learning and Financial Support collective impact working group.\nPlease refer to Section 1.1.1 for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on Instiutional Research’s Dashboard\n\n2.1.1 Food Security\nStudent respondents are assigned a food security level: very low food security, low food security, or food secure, based on their responses to six questions.\nFor more information on this measure, please visit UCOP Measuring Food Insecurity\n\n2.1.1.1 Food Security over Time\nThese visuals display the percentage of respondents who are “food insecure” or very food insecure. For example, in 2022 42% of UCSD undergraduate respondents were classified as food insecure or very food insecure. This means the remaining 58% of respondents were food secure.\nThe percent of undergraduates who are food insecure has remained relatively stable over time. UCSD’s food insecurity rates are slightly lower or equal to the overall UC system rate for this time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Food Security Differences by Group\nFocusing on UCSD students in 2022, we find that there are significant differences by student group. Some student groups have higher than the student body average food security rate, including students who are not First Generation (64% food secure), not Pell Grant Recipients (64%), or are White (63%) or Asian (61%). The international student food security rate is the same as the student body average- 58% food secure.\nConversely some student groups have food security rates below the overall student body rate, including American Indian students (50% food secure), First Generation students (49%), Pell Grant recipients (48%), Hispanic or Latinx students (48%) or African American students(44%), For all these groups, at least half of students are food insecure. The span of the difference is 20 percentage points- between students who don’t recieve Pell Grants (64%) and African American students (44%).\n\n\n\n\n\n$title\n[1] \"Food Insecurity for UCSD Undergrads, 2022\"\n\n$subtitle\n[1] \"% Food Insecure\"\n\n$caption\n[1] \"Source: UCUES 2022, UC Infocenter\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Housing Costs\nThe prioritization poll selected two housing questions from the most recent UCUES 2022 wave- these questions had not been asked previously. There are other housing related questions future versions of this document can add to provide historical context.\nThe question block prompts: “For the following statements, please indicate whether the statement was never true, sometimes true, or often true for you during the current academic year:”\n“I was unable to pay all the cost of my housing on time.”\n“I was worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing”\nRespondents could select “Never True”, “Sometime True” or “Often True.” For consistency in selecting negative e responses - I focus on “Sometime True” and “Often True: responses- meaning that respondents were unable to pay and worried about their housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20% of students were sometimes or often unable to pay on time. This proportion is slightly higher than the UC average of 77% of students always able to pay (not pictured). Within UCSD, the proportion of students unable to pay on time ranges from 28% for African American students to 11% for American Indian students, a 17 percentage point difference.\nWhile most students are always able to pay, the proportion who worry about paying housing costs is higher. Overall 46% worry -similar to the UC average of 45%. However, there is a wide range by student groups at UCSD, from 55% of students not received Pell, to only 32% of Pell grant recipients, a difference of over 20 percentage points. This means that almost 70% of Pell Grant Recipients and First Generation students sometimes or often worry about paying for housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Worried about Debt/Finances\nUCUES has asked “How often during the past academic year have you: Worried about my debt and financial circumstances?” since 2014.\nThe question has six possible responses -from negative - Very Often, Often,Somewhat Often, to more positive, Occasionally, Rarely, Never.\nOverall, UCSD’s students are similar to or slightly less worried than the UC average, with the percent of students worried falling for both in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s notable that while 2022 saw a decrease in students worried, stark differences remain by student group,\n\n\n2.1.4 Manageable Costs\nForty-two percent of students somewhat disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree that the total cost of attending UCSD is manageable in 2022, given the the grants and scholarships they receive. Over the past four waves of UCUES, UCSD has had slightly higher proportions of students disagree than the UC average.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the consistent gaps by student group observed for other affordability questions partially reverse in this question.\nPell grant recipients have the highest rates of agreement, 70%, an over 22 percentage point difference from students not recieving Pell. American Indian, First Generation and Hispanic /Latinx students also have higher than average rates of agreement. This divergent pattern may reflect the variety of financial supports these students have access to. However, African American students have lower rates of agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Additional UCUES Questions related to Affordability.\nThese questions are also available on the 2022 UCUES for further exploration.\n\nOverall, I feel the education is affordable at my campus\nHow satisfied are you with the following aspect of your campus experiences/education? Value of your education for the price you are paying.\nHow concerned have you been about paying for your undergraduate education up to now?\n…Next Year?\nHow often during the past academic year have you: cut down on personal / recreational spending to help pay for college expenses?"

The following draw from the UC Graduate Student Experience Survey in 2021, with the exception of Food Security, which includes data from the 2016 Graduate Student Wellbeing Survey.
