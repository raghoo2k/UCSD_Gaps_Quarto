This is a chapter about affordable learning and financial support at University of California San Diego. @sec-alfs-undergrads details undergraduates' experiences, using information from the UCUES survey. @sec-alfs-grads explores graduate student experiences using the UCGSES survey. @sec-course-material explores results from a one-time survey of undergraduate students on their experiences with buying course materials. Finally, an appendix @sec-alfs-rr provides the number of respondents for each survey question by student group. Readers should note that the number of American Indian student respondents is low,about 36 respondents for the UCUES questions and too few to report for UCGSES. While this low response number is in line with the low number of American Indian students at UCSD, the low number means one or two students' responses can change the overall takeaway for any given question. You may see high variability in responses for this group as a result.

## Undergraduates {#sec-alfs-undergrads}

This section covers a few questions prioritized by the Affordable Learning and Financial Support collective impact working group. Please refer to @sec-UCUES for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on [Institutional Research's Dashboard](https://tableau.ucsd.edu/#/views/UCUES_UC_SanDiego/Affordability?:iid=1)

### Food Security

The UC food security measure is defined by a student's responses to a set of six questions. Each student is assigned a status of "very low food security", "low food security", or "food secure" For more information on this measure, please visit [UCOP Measuring Food Insecurity](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/measuring-food-insecurity.pdf)

These visuals display the combined percentage of respondents who are "food insecure" or "very food insecure". For example, in 2022, 42% of UCSD undergraduate respondents were classified as food insecure or very food insecure, and the remaining 58% of respondents were classified as food secure. The percent of undergraduates who are food insecure has remained relatively stable over time. UCSD's food insecurity rates are slightly lower or equal to the overall UC system rate for this time period.

Focusing on UCSD students in 2022, we find that there are substantial differences by student group. In comparison to the all undergraduate proportion of 42% food insecure, the proportion is higher for Pell Grant recipients (51%), first-generation students (52%),  African American students (55%), Hispanic/Latinx students (52%) and American Indian students (50%) and Transfer students (50%). Overall, there is ~18 percentage point difference between the group with the lowest food insecurity - domestic, White students (37%) and that with the highest, domestic, African American students (55%).

### Housing Costs

The prioritization poll selected two housing questions from the most recent UCUES 2022 wave- these questions had not been asked on earlier waves. There are other housing related questions that future versions of this document can add to provide historical context.

The question block prompts: "For the following statements, please indicate whether the statement was never true, sometimes true, or often true for you during the current academic year:"

"I was unable to pay all the cost of my housing on time."

"I was worried I would not have enough money to cover the cost of my housing"

Respondents could select "Never True", "Sometimes True" or "Often True." For consistency in selecting negative responses - we focus on "Sometimes True" and "Often True" responses- meaning that respondents were unable to pay and worried about their housing costs.

```

About 20% of UCSD students were sometimes or often unable to pay on time. This proportion is slightly lower than the UC average of 23% of students unable to pay (not pictured).

Within UCSD, the proportion of students unable to pay on time ranges from 28% for African American students to 11% for American Indian students, a 17 percentage point difference.

The proportion of students who worry about paying housing costs is higher than that of student who are unable to pay. Overall 46% of UCSD students worry -inline with the UC proportion of 45% (not pictured). However, there is a wide range by student groups at UCSD, from 68% of Pell Grant students being worried to only 44% of those who don't receive Pell grant, a difference of over 20 percentage points. The proportions for Hispanic/Latinx and African American students who are more worried is also high, around 62%.

### Worried about Debt/Finances

UCUES has asked "How often during the past academic year have you: Worried about debt and financial circumstances?" since 2014.

The question has six possible responses -three coded negative: Very Often, Often, Somewhat Often, and three as more positive: Occasionally, Rarely, Never. We focus here on the negative responses. 

Overall, UCSD's students are similar to or slightly less worried than the UC average, with the percent of students worried falling for both in 2022.

### Manageable Costs

Forty-two percent of students somewhat disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree that the total cost of attending UCSD is manageable, given the the grants and scholarships they receive. Over the past four waves of UCUES, UCSD has had slightly higher proportions of students disagree that the cost is manageable than the UC average.

Interestingly, the consistent gaps by student group observed for other affordability questions partially reverse in this question. Those who do not receive Pell Grants, and not first-generation students have a higher proportion of negative responses. 49% of students not receiving Pell Grants disagree that the cost of UCSD is manageable, compared to 30% of Pell Grant recipients. The direction also reverses for Transfer students who have lower proporitons of negative responses than first-time-first-year students.

### Participating in High Impact Practices

Some students may be unable to participate in high impact practices like research experiences, internships, and service learning if the direct or indirect cost of participation is too high. For more on patterns in student participation in high impact practices, please see @sec-iie-hip in the Academic and Learning Experiences chapter.

### Additional UCUES Questions related to Affordability.

These questions are also available on the 2022 UCUES for further exploration.

-   Overall, I feel the education is affordable at my campus
-   How satisfied are you with the following aspect of your campus experiences/education? Value of your education for the price you are paying.
-   How concerned have you been about paying for your undergraduate education up to now?
-   ...Next Year?
-   How often during the past academic year have you: cut down on personal / recreational spending to help pay for college expenses?

## Graduate Students {#sec-alfs-grads}

There have been fewer consistent questions asked to graduate students over time, and slightly different student groups are available in publicly available data. See data descriptions for more detail. The following draw from the UC Graduate Student Experience Survey in 2021, with the exception of Food Security, which includes data from the 2016 Graduate Student Wellbeing Survey. Please refer to @sec-UCGSES for more on UCGSES.

### Food Security

For the two waves available for Graduate Students, UCSD has similar rates of food insecurity in comparison with the UC average.

### Financial hardship has impeded my success in my program.


Graduate students were asked to indicate their agreement with this statement "Financial Hardship has impeded my success in my program." Students who selected "Strongly Agree", "Agree", and "Somewhat Agree" were coded as "negative" responses.

While about 36% of students agreed that financial hardship had impeded their success, similar to the all-UC rate of 35% (not pictured), that number rises to 52% for Hispanic/Latinx students.  First-generation, LGBT, African American, Doctoral students, and International students also have higher levels of agreement than average.

### I've been concerned about money lately.

This question continues the format of the previous, with similar patterns of differences between groups. The UCSD proportion of students who agree they are concerned about money lately is about 66%, similar the all-UC proportion of 67%.

### I'm confident in my financial situation.

For this question, "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree", and "Somewhat Disagree" were considered negative responses. There is a divergence between UCSD and the all UC rate, with a lower proportion of UCSD students disagreeing - 31% vs 34% of all UC respondents.

### I can get by financially without having to cut back on too many of the things that are important to me.

For this question, "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree", and "Somewhat Disagree" were considered negative responses. Again, the proportion for all UCSD students (32%) is relatively similiar to the all UC proportion (34%)

## Course Material Student Survey {#sec-course-material}

The following paragraphs are quoted verbatim from the Affordable / Open course Materials Report - May 2022. 

In November 2021, a team from the Library and the Teaching + Learning Commons (April Cha, Dani Cook, Leah Klement, Lisa Martin, and Allegra Swift) fielded a population-level survey about student experiences with obtaining and using course materials. 

With help from William Armstrong in Institutional Research, we sent 32,827 survey invitations to UC San Diego undergraduate students. 2,153 students consented and participated in the survey, for a response rate of 6.6%. Demographic characteristics of both the full population and responding population fell within 2 percentage points of each other for college, major department, race, first-generation status, and Pell eligibility. Female students were overrepresented in the responding population, and transfer students were slightly underrepresented in respondents.

Questions on the survey related to student spending on course materials in fall 2021; how students pay for course materials; student strategies when they don’t own course materials; student interest in an inclusive access program; academic, social, and basic needs impacts of course materials cost and access; and format preference. 

### Student Spending

The largest number of students reported spending under \$100 (38%) on course materials in fall 2021. However, a similar number of students reported spending between \$100 and \$199 dollars (33.4%), and the remaining 29% reported spending over \$200 on course materials. A small number of students (.7%) reported spending more than \$600. One representative statement was, “I think it’s expected to spend money on courses and textbooks, it just hits lower-income students harder for obvious reasons.”

Some free-text responses mention departments that already keep material costs low, including CSE and political science. These may be areas to reach out to for more information.

We also investigated if there was a relationship between how much students spent on course materials and their usage. There does appear to be a correlation between cost and usage (p<.001). In general, students reported using most (above 80%) of their required course materials across categories (31.2% of respondents). However, there were numerous students who reported that they used below 50% of their assigned course materials in a quarter, and the qualitative data represented that some students felt frustrated that they were assigned materials that they did not use in the course. Student comments related to this topics included: “I do not mind buying course materials if it is used for at least 50% of the course. Otherwise it feels like a waste” and “It would be great if professors specified beforehand if we will actually be using the textbook. Sometimes it’s listed as required but never used.” This was the second-most commented-on topic in the qualitative data.

Of students who spent below \$100, 10% of them reported never using any of their course materials. However, the preponderance of students in this category (31.4%) reported using 80% or more of their assigned course materials.

For the top spenders (students who spend \$600 or more), most (56.25%) reported using most of their materials, and all reported using at least some.

Latinx students were slightly more likely to spend in the higher price bands than other groups.

By a significant margin, most students reported that they paid for their course materials through money provided by family, friends, or caregivers (43.3%), followed by money they had earned themselves (29.9%) and grants (12.7%).  The chart below demonstrates differences across racial categories:

![Student Source of Payment for Course Materials: Race/Ethnicity](viz/alfs/AOCM_student_spending.png)

White and Asian/Asian American students are much more likely to report having family, friend, or caregiver support for purchasing course materials.

Similar disparate impacts were demonstrated due to first-generation status:

![Student Source of Payment for Course Materials: first-generation Status](viz/alfs/AOCM_student_spending_1g.png)

80% of students reported having to purchase access codes (one-time-use codes to access homework sets, quizzes, or other ancillary materials) during their time at UC San Diego. There does not appear to be a relationship between student major and access code purchasing, indicating that this is a broadly utilized type of course material across disciplines. It is also unclear from our data if access codes are more often used in major courses or in general education.

By far, access codes was the area that students shared the most about in the qualitative data. “Frustration” was the most commonly used adjective. One student shared, “Purchasing access codes to complete homework for a grade is ridiculous. We already pay tuition, we shouldn’t have to pay hundreds for our grades too.”

### Strategies for Obtaining Course Materials

96% of students who answered the survey indicated that they had attempted to reduce course material costs during their UC San Diego career. 64% of students shared that they had downloaded a “free” textbook from the Internet (we did not ask about the legal status of the copy) and almost half of students (49%) relying on materials that course instructors provided through Canvas or other means.

The most common reason given for seeking alternative methods to buying a course material was because of the cost of the book, followed by because only a small portion of the material was used in class. Only a small number of students (1.8%) indicated familiarity with library course reserves.

### Inclusive Access Program Interest

66% of students said they would be interested in a standardized fee for materials from the Bookstore (though many indicated they wanted to know more about the cost). Without having additional details, 95% of respondents believed that a reasonable cost for such a program would be under $150 per quarter.

### Basic Needs Impacts

27% of students who responded to the survey indicated that they had to make a choice between purchasing course materials and basic needs.

41.6% of Pell-eligible students who answered the question about basic needs reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.

In comparison, 20.3% of non-Pell-eligible students who answered this question reported having to make a decision between course materials and basic needs.

The most commonly reported basic need impacted was access to food, followed by mental health/well-being and utilities.

![](viz/alfs/AOCM_basic_needs.png)

### Academic and Social Impacts

The survey also asked questions about how access to course materials impacted their academic and social lives at UC San Diego. 

14.2% of students overall reported that lack of access to course materials strongly impacted their understanding of key course concepts. This impact was felt variably across demographic categories. Notably, 20.9% of Latinx students reported a strong impact on their understanding of course concepts, while only 9.6% of white students reported a strong impact.

Overall, 10.9% of students reported that a lack of access to course materials has affected their feeling of belonging in their course or major. Again, this impact was felt variably across demographic categories. 28.1% of black students reported a strong impact, while only 7.7% of white students reported the same. This was also true across low-income students (as identified by Pell-grant eligibility), where 41.6% of Pell-eligible students reported an impact on feelings of belonging, in contrast to 29% of non-Pell-eligible students.

### Format Preferences

Students were queried for their format preferences for course materials. There is a strong belief that students prefer electronic sources; however, our survey results indicate that may not be an accurate belief. While students preferred PDFs or other digital documents, this was closely followed by professional printed textbooks. The below chart demonstrates the rank-ordered student preferences.

## Understanding Stopout Patterns


* The UC Infocenter provides a [dashboard on all stop-outs in the UC between 2001-2015](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/ug-stop-outs). This dashboard can be filtered to show students who entered UCSD.The following shows results for UCSD students, but the chart titles still reflect the overall UC population (e.g 50,000 undergraduates)
![UCSD Stopouts](viz\alfs\ucstopout.png)
* The UC Infocenter also provides the results of a [survey of UC students](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/uc-stopouts) who had enrolled in the UC from 2000-2018, with a focus on respondents who has not completed a bachelor's degree nor were enrolled in college. Results can be filtered to show just UCSD.
Many respondents cited financial reasons as barriers to re-enrolling. 
![Barriers to Reentry](viz\alfs\barriers.png)

* A UCSD-specific working group has been working since Winter 2022 to: 

    + Understand why undergrad students may stop-out
    + Analyze data to identify patterns and trends causing students to stop-out
    + Offer resources to guide students to return and feel supported to continue studies

 This work is ongoing but Affordable Learning and Financial Support Working group members can find a summary of their work in their Google Drive folder.
