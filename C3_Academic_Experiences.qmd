This is a chapter about academic and learning experiences at University of California San Diego. 

@sec-iie-undergrads details undergraduates' experiences, using information from the UCUES survey. @sec-iie-grads explores graduate student experiences using the UCGSES survey.  Finally, an appendix @sec-iie-rr provides the number of respondents for each survey question by student group. 

Readers should note that the number of American Indian student respondents is low,about 36 respondents for the UCUES questions and too few to report for UCGSES. While this low response number is in line with the low number of American Indian students at UCSD, the low number means one or two students' responses can change the overall takeaway for any given question. You may see high variability in responses for this group as a result. 


This chapter continues be updated and edited with additional interpretation and student groups - most recent updates 3/21/23.

## Undergraduates {#sec-iie-undergrads}

This section draws from recent waves of the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey. 
Please refer to @sec-UCUES for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on [Institutional Research's Dashboard](https://tableau.ucsd.edu/#/views/UCUES_UC_SanDiego/AcademicEngagement?:iid=1)


### Overall Academic Experience

Students rate their overall academic experience by choosing one of six responses, from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. We combine students responding to "somewhat dissatisfied", "dissatisfied", and "very dissatisfied" together to show patterns of negative student responses.

From 2016-2020, the overall student body at UCSD reported higher rates of dissatisfaction than the all UC average. However, the 2022 survey wave found rates of dissatisfaction much lower at both UCSD and all across the UC, a positive trend.

Comparing within the UCSD for the 2022 wave, rates of dissatisfaction are slightly higher for Transfer students, First Generation students, students receiving Pell Grants, African American, Hispanic/Latinx and American Indian students than the study body average of 12% at least somewhat dissatisfied.

### Interactions with Faculty


#### Having faculty who know your name, and can write letters of recommendations

About 40% of UCSD undergraduates report faculty not knowing their names and about half report not being known by any faculty well enough to ask for a letter of recommendation. However, the difference between students are not all that large, with the exception of Asian American students, of who 47% report faculty rarely or never know their name and 53% don't know faculty well enough to ask for a letter of recommendation. 

```{r}

####Faculty providing prompt and useful feedback on student work
Open channels of communication between faculty and students regarding student needs, concerns, and suggestions

#### Faculty are genuinely committed to promoting respect for and understanding of group differences at UC

### Engagement in High Impact Practices

The following data points are drawn from a [special dashboard](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/ug-research-internships-service-learning) which combines student responses across multiple questions. These response show only respondents who graduated in the survey year- to focus on students who had time to connect with these opportunities. Please also note that these visuals show participation proportions - generally speaking higher rates of participation are a positive - the color scheme is reversed from other visualizations to reflect this change. 

Most students participate in some form of high impact practices while at UCSD. Across the UC, about 75% of students near graduation in 2022 had  participated in a research activity, creative project, an internship, nor academic service learning. The proportion at UCSD is 74%, a near match. 

The largest equity gap in participation is between Transfer students and FTFY students-about 14 percentage points, perhaps partially reflecting the compressed time on campus for Transfer students. The equity gap between First-Generation and not First-Generation, as well as Pell Grant and Not-Pell Grant recipients is similar, with about a 11-12 percentage point gap.

```


#### Research and/or Creative Projects

About half (52%) of students nearing graduation in 2022 had participated in a research activity or creative project at UCSD. This is slightly lower than the all UC average of 54% of students having participated by graduation.
