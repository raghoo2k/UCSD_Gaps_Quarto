This is a chapter about mentoring, coaching, and advising at University of California San Diego. 

@sec-mca-undergrads details undergraduates' experiences, using information from the UCUES survey. @sec-mca-grads explores graduate student experiences using the UCGSES survey.  Finally, an appendix @sec-mca-rr provides the number of respondents for each survey question by student group. 

Readers should note that the number of American Indian student respondents is low,about 36 respondents for the UCUES questions and too few to report for UCGSES. While this low response number is in line with the low number of American Indian students at UCSD, the low number means one or two students' responses can change the overall takeaway for any given question. You may see high variability in responses for this group as a result. 


This chapter continues be updated and edited with additional interpretation and student groups - most recent updates 7/06/23.

## Graduate Students {#sec-mca-grads}

The student groups available in publicly available data differ slightly for graduate students. The following draw from the UC Graduate Student Experience Survey in 2021.  Please refer to @sec-UCGSES for more on UCGSES. Please note that there are a very small number of "Professional Practice" (MD, Pharm.D.) student respondents (~35) on these questions, which skew more positive than the graduate student body average. Interpret these trends with additional caution. 

### Faculty Advising and Mentoring

An overview of all UC graduate student responses related to faculty advising and mentoring is available at this [link](https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/survey-documents-graduate/2021-ucgses-advising.pdf).Graduate students across the UC, and also within UC San Diego, identified advising as one of their top three priorities.

![UC San Diego Graduate Student Priorities 2021](viz/mca/grad_priorities_ucsd.png)

#### The mentorship and advising I receive in my program

84% of UC San Diego graduate student respondents reported being at least somewhat satisfied with the mentorship and advising they received in their program, slightly higher than the all UC average of 81%. Satisfaction with thesis and dissertation research is also slightly higher, 86% at UC San Diego vs 84% at the UC, while satisfaction with career support is about the same, ~75% of students reporting being at least somewhat satisfied at both UC San Diego and within the UC more broadly. 


![UC San Diego Graduate Student Priorities 2021](viz/mca/grad_advising_sat_by_campus.png)


Looking at difference in satisfaction within UC San Diego, LGBTQ+ students and Hispanic/Latinx students at UC San Diego report the lowest levels of satisfaction, disparities also present in the UC analysis.

#### Opportunities to form research/academic mentorship relationships with faculty members
Master's students and Hispanic/Latinx students report difficulties in finding opportunities to form research and academic mentorship relationships with faculty members at UC San Diego.

```
### Additional Relationships between Advising and Student Outcomes

While the Collective Impact team currently does not have sufficient data access to replicate analyses at UC San Diego, the [UC system-wide report](https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/survey-documents-graduate/2021-ucgses-advising.pdf) found the following relationships between advising and student outcomes:

* Students reported more variation regarding the frequency with which they met their advisor. For
example, eight percent reported meeting zero times in the past term and 22 percent reported
meeting more than six times. Reported meeting frequency was strongly associated with advisor
satisfaction ratings.

* Satisfaction with mentorship and advising was associated with greater self-reports of student
engagement in day-to-day work and being on track to complete one’s degree program on time.

*  Advisors who met more frequently with their students received more favorable ratings regarding
their career advice. Students who were satisfied with their ad visor tended to feel more upbeat
about their post-graduation career prospects and reported having a greater sense of direction
for their career post-graduation.

* Advisor satisfaction was negatively associated with depressive symptomology.
