This is a chapter about Sense of Belonging at University of California San Diego. @sec-sob-undergrads details undergraduates' experiences, using information from the UCUES survey. @sec-sob-grads explores graduate student experiences using the UCGSES survey. Finally, an appendix @sec-sob-rr provides the number of respondents for each survey question by student group. 

Readers should note that the number of American Indian student respondents is low,about 36 respondents for the UCUES questions and too few to report for UCGSES. While this low response number is in line with the low number of American Indian students at UCSD, the low number means one or two students' responses can change the overall takeaway for any given question. You may see high variability in responses for this group as a result. 

This chapter continues be updated and edited with additional interpretation and student groups - most recent updates 6/22/23.

## Undergraduates (UCUES 2022) {#sec-sob-undergrads}

This section draws from recent waves of the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey. 
Please refer to @sec-UCUES for more information on UCUES. For readers affiliated with UCSD and a working Active Directory login, a few longitudinal questions can be explored on [Institutional Research's Dashboard](https://tableau.ucsd.edu/#/views/UCUES_UC_SanDiego/AcademicEngagement?:iid=1)

Members of the Sense of Belonging Collective Impact working group can also view a more in-depth multi-variate analysis of undergraduate sense of belonging prepared by colleagues in Institutional Research and Equity Diversity and Inclusion, available at this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y_b76erhjAq9Ky0YuSgpK-8mcZ4UAs2I/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112204274306994201533&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### UCSD-wide Sense of Belonging

#### I feel I belong at this University
UC San Diego undergraduates have consistently reported feeling a lower sense of belonging at their university than the UC system average. However, 2022 brought an increase to UCSD -with 80% of students at least somewhat agreeing they feel they belong at UCSD. This survey wave also brought the smallest differenc between UCSD and and the UC system.

#### I feel valued as an individual at this institution

The overall proportion of students who feel valued as an individual is lower than the proportion who feel they belong, at 72%. While a substantially lower than average proportion of African American students reports feeling valued (62%), the next lowest group is white students.

```

While overall about 86% of UC undergraduates feel comfortable with the climate for diversity and inclusion on campus, and about 80% feel that channels are readily available to address discrimination, these proportions are much lower for African American students, and slightly lower than average for Hispanic/Latinx and American Indian Students.

#### Black Undergraduate Student Experience

These survey questions are just one of many avenues in which Black students at UC San Diego have shared their experiences of disconnection and exclusion.T The [Black Academic Excellence Initiative](https://diversity.ucsd.edu/initiatives/black-academic-excellence/index.html) provides a more holistic review and summary of current programmatic efforts to change how the university supports Black students. See for example, the following slide from a recent presentation: 

![Black Academic Excellence Initiative Presentation](viz/sob/BAEI_sob_UG.png)
While slides are not currently available online, the [Enhancing the Black Student Experience Symposium](https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/student-centeredness/enhancing-the-black-student-experience.html) is another useful resource

## Graduate Students (UCGSES) {#sec-sob-grads}

The student groups available in publicly available data differ slightly for graduate students. The following draw from the UC Graduate Student Experience Survey in 2021.  Please refer to @sec-UCGSES for more on UCGSES. Please note that there are a very small number of "Professional Practice" (MD, Pharm.D.) student respondents (~31) on these questions, which skew more positive than the graduate student body average. The response count for African American graduate students is also small (18).  Interpret these trends with additional caution. 

As of 6/22, we have also added a few screengrabs from an additional UC San Diego Graduate student survey - GradSERU

### Interactions with Faculty
#### I feel included by the faculty
 
 Graduate students generally feel included by faculty, resembling the proportions who feel included by administration and staff. LGBT graduate students are one exception, with 79% feeling included, 6 percentage points lower than average.

### Interactions with Peers

#### I feel included by my peers

Across graduate student groups, about 91% feel included by peers and there are not strong differences between groups.

#### There is a sense of solidarity among the students
These visuals come from the [2021 gradSERU at UCSD](https://ir.ucsd.edu/grad/surveys/gradseru/gradseru-results2021.html). The 80% yellow dot represents that campus average of 80% in comparison to displayed student subpopulations.

* There is a strong sense of community among graduate students at the university.


### Interactions with Administrators and Staff

#### I feel included by... the administration and staff"
The proportion of graduate students who feel included by the administration and staff is a bit lower than that for included by peers, at about 85%, with a few groups slightly lower than that average, including African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and Asian American.

### General Belonging
#### To Be Visualized
* The university is hostile toward students when they raise concerns.
* My graduate program is hostile toward students when they raise concerns.
* In the past 12 months, have you been on the receiving end of a significant instance of bias, discrimination or harassment by someone in your graduate program? (another student, faculty member, member of administration or staff, by member of another group)
